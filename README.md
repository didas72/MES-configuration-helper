MES/RAI Configuration Helper is a tool made to help you set up the files needed to making a MES/RAI mod. This will not only ensure everything in you files are correctly made but will also show you some MES features you may not know.
Both MES and RAI are mods made for Space Engineers made by MeridiusIX.
